    <p>
      My name is Dominick Geronimo, I am an author and Father of two wonderful children. I have always been a tech
      minded individual and have been studying programming and hardware for as long as I can remember. I custom built
      my own computer that I use to stream video games on Twitch at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/eravander" target="_blank">www.twitch.tv/eravander</a>
      and to write my Urban Fantasy books. Now I am adding coding to the list of primary uses for the machine. I am
      also an amateur chef and homebrewer, creating things is a passion of mine.
    </p>

      I am currently working on a novel that is tentatively titled, "Niruko". I am hoping that by the end of this
      class I will have the skills I need to find a primary job to support my side endeavors. So far this class has
      been an incredibly rewarding experience and I honestly can't wait to learn more.
