# Responsive-Portfolio

This is a responsive site, down to 640px, that serves as a draft of my portfolio and homework for the UNCC Coding Bootcamp in 2019.

This is built using primarily bootstrap as a proof of understanding the use of CSS libraries in site design but also has custom CSS elements. 

Current active potfolio is a WIP.
